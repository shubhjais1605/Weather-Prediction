Performed basic EDA

Considered 2022 dataset for analysis for a city.

  Algorithms used:

  Linear Regression

  KNN 

  XGBoost Regressor 

  Random Forest Rregressor
  
Conclusion: Got 4.8 RMSE and 0.81 Explained variance for Random Forest model

In this study, a Random Forest model was used to predict weather conditions based on a variety of meteorological factors. The model outperformed other machine learning algorithms, including XGBoost, Linear Regression, and KNN regressor, making it the most effective choice for this prediction task.

With an RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) of 4.8, the model demonstrates a relatively low level of error, suggesting that its predictions are close to the actual observed values. Additionally, an Explained Variance of 0.812 indicates that the model captures approximately 81.2% of the variance in the weather data. This high explained variance signifies that the Random Forest model effectively captures complex patterns and relationships within the dataset.

Given the nature of weather, which involves numerous dynamic variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure, the Random Forest algorithm’s ability to handle high-dimensional and non-linear data proves advantageous. While other models like KNN and Linear Regression showed promising results, they could not match the balance of accuracy and generalization achieved by Random Forest.

In conclusion, the Random Forest model provides a robust and reliable framework for weather prediction, offering high accuracy and capturing the majority of the variability in weather conditions.
